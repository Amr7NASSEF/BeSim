## Algorithms and Models
List of key enabling algorithms and models implemented in BuiSim.

**Building Models**
- [Linearized white-box building envelope models](http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp/article.asp?issue=118&article=005&volume=)
- arbitrary linear time invariant model in state space format

**Optimal Control**
- Model predictive control (MPC)
- [Approximate MPC via machine learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261918302903)

**State Estimation**
- Kalman filters
- Moving horizon estimation

**Machine Learning Models**
- Deep learning
- Regression trees

## Features
- Matlab interface for loading linearized white-box building envelope models from Modelica
- Automated construction and tuning of MPC and state estimation algorithms
- Closed-loop simulation, plotting, and performance analysis
- Approximate MPC via machine learning (deep lerarning in particular)
- FMI interface for Modelica emulator models (comming soon)

## Structure
List of repository folders with associated functionality.
- Bui_Run (run files)
- Bui_Modeling (model loading, discretization, model order reduction)
- Bui_Disturbances (disturbance trajectories loading)
- Bui_References (reference trajectories loading)
