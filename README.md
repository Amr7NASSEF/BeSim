## Algorithms and Models

###  Building Models
- Linearized white-box building envelope models in state space format

###  Optimal Control
- Model predictive control (MPC)
- [Approximate MPC via machine learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261918302903)

###  State Estimation
- Kalman filters
- Moving horizon estimation

###  Machine Learning Models
- Deep learning
- Regression trees

## Features
- Interface for linearized white-box building envelope models from Modelica
- Automated construction and tuning of MPC and state estimation algorithms
- Closed-loop simulation, plotting, and performance analysis
- Approximate MPC via machine learning (deep lerarning in particular)
- FMI interface for Modelica emulator models (comming soon)

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/drgona/BuiSim/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/drgona/BuiSim/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact
